# Notes:
# - pandas was removed to avoid build-time C-extension compilation on
#   Streamlit Cloud. If you need pandas locally, install it in your
#   development environment (e.g., pip install pandas).
# - langchain and FAISS were removed to avoid installation of compiled
#   native extensions on Streamlit Cloud. Re-add them only if you deploy
#   with Docker or on an environment that provides system build tools.
